/**
 * dsh-opencodego — the OpenCode Go native adapter plugin.
 *
 * Registers ONE provider route, `opencode-go-native`, on `ctx.llm`, serving
 * every model the configured gateway advertises with the correct wire protocol
 * per model. The route key deliberately differs from the official
 * `opencode-go` pi-ai route so the two never collide in the adapter registry.
 *
 * Phase 2 adds: the plugin's bundled model-state file for capability prefill
 * (context/maxTokens/input modalities/reasoning levels), the npm-rule protocol
 * decision with an ordered per-model candidate chain and pre-first-chunk
 * fallback, endpoint health classification, and the learning memo that keeps a
 * refused protocol from being paid for twice. The settings page is phase 4.
 * Since 0.6.5 there are exactly TWO model sources: the gateway's `/models`
 * list (which models exist) and the plugin's own state (this file plus the
 * settings overlay — what dsh loads). Nothing is fetched from models.dev at
 * runtime.
 *
 * @module dsh-opencodego
